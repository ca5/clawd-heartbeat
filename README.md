# Clawd Heartbeat

*[日本語版はこちら / Japanese version](README.ja.md)*

A physical status indicator for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), driven by a single LED on an M5Atom Lite. Even when you're not looking at the terminal, you can tell at a glance — from the corner of your eye — whether Claude is **working**, **blocked waiting for your approval**, or **done**.

**No electronics skills needed.** No soldering, no wiring — the only electronic part is a single off-the-shelf M5Atom Lite (under $15 / ¥2,000). Buy it, flash it, drop it in the printed shell.

Put it inside a 3D-printed Clawd figure with a dead-front heart window, and you get a desk companion whose heart beats while Claude works and pounds red when it needs you.

Supplementary docs (currently in Japanese):

- [`LIFECYCLE.md`](docs/LIFECYCLE.md) — how Claude Code's hook events map to LED states, including the blind spots (why the LED stays red after you hit Yes, etc.)
- [`NOTES.md`](docs/NOTES.md) — design decision log and empirically measured hook behavior that the official docs don't cover
- [`HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md) — original design rationale and rejected alternatives (e.g. why serial doesn't work on the Atom Lite)

## LED states

| State | Appearance | Trigger (hook) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `idle` | Blue, steady (1/2 brightness) | SessionStart / SessionEnd |
| `tool` | White breathing (1.5 s cycle) — **reads as pink** through an orange case | UserPromptSubmit / PreToolUse / PostToolUse |
| `wait` | Red 400 ms blink for 30 s, then steady red (idle after 10 min) | PermissionRequest / AskUserQuestion dialog (detected in led.sh) |
| `done` | Green 150 ms blink for 6 s | Stop |
| `err` | Red fast blink (120 ms) | StopFailure |
| rainbow | Rainbow swirl for 10 s, then back to the current state | Pressing the front button (the LED face) |
| off | Auto-off 30 min after the last request; any request wakes it | — |

![The heart cycling through idle, working, waiting for approval, and done](docs/img/demo.gif)

*Idle → working → **waiting for your approval** → back to work → done. (Recorded with `./led-demo.sh clip`.)*

Note on the pink heart: `tool` drives the LED white, but orange PLA absorbs green strongly, so what comes through the heart window is red + blue — a pink/magenta glow. It's a happy accident we kept. With a different filament color, expect a different shade (the `led-tuning` skill helps you re-pick colors).

**Multi-session support**: the firmware tracks state per session (up to 8) and aggregates with priority `wait > err > done > tool > idle`. If any session is waiting for approval, the LED blinks red no matter what the others are doing. Sessions expire after 10 minutes without updates.

## Hardware

- M5Atom Lite (ESP32-PICO-D4), onboard SK6812 × 1 (GPIO27)
- USB Type-C, always powered
- No additional components

## Setup

### The easy way: let Claude Code do it

This repo ships with a `CLAUDE.md` and two skills. Clone it, open Claude Code inside, and just say:

> **"set this up"** — walks you through WiFi config, flashing, fixing the IP, and hook installation, verifying each step
>
> **"the green looks dim through my case"** (or any color/brightness complaint) — the `led-tuning` skill measures translucency with your actual filament and adjusts colors iteratively

The manual steps below are the same procedure, if you prefer doing it yourself.

### 1. Build and flash

Requirement: [PlatformIO Core CLI](https://platformio.org/) (`brew install platformio`)

```bash
cp include/secrets.h.example include/secrets.h   # fill in your WiFi SSID/password (2.4 GHz only)
pio run -t upload
```

If the board won't enter download mode, hold the button (the LED face itself) while plugging in USB.

On first boot, read the IP and MAC from serial, then give the device a fixed IP via your router's DHCP reservation:

```bash
pio device monitor   # prints "ready: http://<IP>" and "mac: <MAC>"
```

`platform = espressif32@6.9.0` is pinned on purpose — do not bump it casually (see docs/NOTES.md).

### 2. Hook setup

Copy [`led.sh`](led.sh) to `~/.claude/led.sh` and change the IP inside to match your device:

```bash
cp led.sh ~/.claude/led.sh && chmod +x ~/.claude/led.sh
```

led.sh is more than a curl wrapper (details in docs/NOTES.md):

- Extracts `session_id` from the hook JSON on stdin and reports state per session
- Converts AskUserQuestion (choice dialog) display into `wait`
- While a dialog is awaiting your answer, keeps a marker file so that tool events
  from subagents (which share the parent's session_id) can't overwrite the red —
  only the completion of the awaited tool call clears it
- While a dialog is open, tails the session transcript to catch denials and
  Ctrl+C interrupts (which fire no hook event) and clears the red within seconds
- Attaches a millisecond send timestamp so the device can drop out-of-order
  updates from async hooks

Merge the following into `hooks` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (`"async": true` on every event is required):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart":      [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh idle", "async": true }] }],
    "UserPromptSubmit":  [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh tool", "async": true }] }],
    "PreToolUse":        [{ "matcher": "*", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh tool", "async": true }] }],
    "PostToolUse":       [{ "matcher": "*", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh tool", "async": true }] }],
    "PostToolUseFailure": [{ "matcher": "*", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh tool", "async": true }] }],
    "PermissionRequest": [{ "matcher": "*", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh wait", "async": true }] }],
    "PermissionDenied":  [{ "matcher": "*", "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh idle", "async": true }] }],
    "Stop":              [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh done", "async": true }] }],
    "StopFailure":       [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh err", "async": true }] }],
    "SessionEnd":        [{ "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "$HOME/.claude/led.sh idle", "async": true }] }]
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code and confirm the hooks are loaded with `/hooks`.

## FAQ — known behaviors (detected, but nothing we can do)

Claude Code's hooks do not report dialog *answers* or *interruptions*, so the following are accepted as-is. See [LIFECYCLE.md](docs/LIFECYCLE.md) for the full picture.

**Q. I approved (Yes) but it's still red**
No event fires at the moment of approval. The next signal is the *completion* of the approved command, so the red lasts exactly as long as the command runs. Approve a long build and it stays red the whole time. Rule of thumb: blinking red = probably unanswered (first 30 s), steady red = probably answered and a long command is running.

**Q. I denied (No) / hit Ctrl+C, but it's still red**
Denial and interruption fire no hook event at all (verified empirically with a logger on every event). To compensate, led.sh watches the session transcript while a dialog is open and clears the red within a few seconds of a denial or interrupt (best effort — it string-matches transcript entries). Fallbacks if that misses: your next prompt clears it instantly, and it drops to idle after 10 minutes.

**Q. It keeps breathing white after the turn should be over**
Another concurrently open Claude Code session is probably working — the display aggregates all sessions. Run `./led-test.sh status` to see which session holds which state. Leftover manual test sends expire after 2 minutes.

**Q. Nothing is lit**
It auto-offs 30 minutes after the last event. Not a failure — any event wakes it.

**Q. It's purple right after boot**
That's the WiFi-connecting indicator. If it stays purple, check that your SSID is 2.4 GHz.

## HTTP API

| Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `GET /led?s=<state>&sid=<id>&ts=<ms>` | Report state. `state` is idle/tool/wait/done/err; `sid` is a session ID (default: `default`). Updates older than the last applied `ts` are rejected (omit `ts` to always apply) |
| `GET /rgb?r=&g=&b=` | Light an arbitrary color directly (for testing; returns to normal on the next `/led` or after 10 min) |
| `GET /` | Aggregated state, session count/breakdown, uptime, RSSI |

## LED testing

```bash
./led-test.sh coupon        # translucency test for case material (interactive; run in a real terminal)
./led-test.sh states        # replay the 5 states in order
./led-test.sh rgb 0 255 0   # light an arbitrary color
./led-test.sh ramp 0 255 0  # ramp a color through 8 brightness steps
./led-test.sh status        # check device state
./led-test.sh off           # back to idle
```

For filming or a quick visual check, `led-demo.sh` plays the animations automatically — no keypresses, so you can start recording and let it run:

```bash
./led-demo.sh                  # all five states in sequence
./led-demo.sh clip             # 16 s sequence tuned for video/GIF (easiest to film)
./led-demo.sh story            # realistic flow: working → permission → approved → done
./led-demo.sh wait-full        # shows the wait blink → steady transition at 30 s
./led-demo.sh states --solo    # silence other sessions so playback isn't overridden
./led-demo.sh states --loop --lead 10   # repeat, with a 10 s head start
```

Tip: `led-test.sh rgb R G B` holds a fixed color for 10 minutes, which makes still photography much easier than chasing a blink.

The device address comes from the `ATOM` environment variable or a gitignored `.atom-ip` file next to the script.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| LED stays purple | WiFi not connected. Make sure the SSID is 2.4 GHz (5 GHz unsupported) |
| Won't enter download mode | Hold the button while plugging in USB |
| No red on permission prompts | Check `/hooks` shows PermissionRequest loaded |
| Claude Code feels slow | Verify `async: true` on hooks and `-m 1` on curl |
| `pio device monitor` fails | It needs a TTY and can't run in the background; use the pyserial recipe in docs/NOTES.md |

## Case

The case is a pixel-art Clawd figure with a dead-front heart window: a 0.4 mm orange PLA skin printed as part of the body, with an 8–10 mm air gap to the LED. All state colors — including the dim idle blue — read through it. The eyes are printed separately (no AMS needed), the belly and back halves are held together by four 6 mm × 3 mm disc magnets (no screws/glue, opens for reflashing), and cable notches on all four sides let you route USB-C in any direction.
